# RMSSD
For Synetiq

This is a test task for identifing the way how biological activity changes based on the stimulus. There is no full implementation up to the moment,
however it will be useful to start structuring data, reducing noise, and setting up the merging logic of Pandas Series. 

Dependencies which are used are:
-Pandas;
-NumPy;
-OS;

All of them are by default available in IPython.
